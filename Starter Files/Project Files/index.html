  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Air is a key element for optimum health! Try some tips for increasing your lung capacity.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <blockquote cite="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/135.1356#1356">In order to have good blood, we must breathe well. Full, deep inspirations of pure air, which fill the lungs with oxygen, purify the blood. They impart to it a bright color and send it, a life-giving current, to every part of the body. A good respiration soothes the nerves; it stimulates the appetite and renders digestion more perfect; and it induces sound, refreshing sleep.</blockquote>
  <p>Air is the most vital element for humans and animals. We could survive for weeks without food, or days without water, but deprived of air, we would perish within minutes.</p>
  <p>The human body must have oxygen; each of its 100 trillion cells must receive steady, 
fresh supplies to survive. Every day, you take more than 17,000 breaths to keep your body fueled. The heart sends blood to the lungs where it drops off carbon dioxide for elimination and picks up fresh oxygen for delivery to every cell in the body.</p>
 <p>Fresh air has many health benefits. It improves the brain's ability to function, gives clarity to the mind, improves concentration, and boosts learning abilities. 
It gives a sense of happiness and well-being by altering brain levels of serotonin. 
It promotes quality sleep, and kills bacteria and viruses in the air. </p>
 <p>Pollution causes air to lose these capabilities.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips for Improved Respiration</h2>
  <h3>Ventilation</h3>
  <p>Open the windows or set heating and air conditioning units to bring in fresh air. 
Air out your house every day. Keep proper ventilation in mind wherever you are. 
Avoid car exhaust, tobacco smoke, and stuffy ill-ventilated rooms.</p>
  <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
  <p>Take several deep breaths to clear your mind and increase your energy level:</p>
  <h3>Exercise</h3>
  <p>A good workout forces you to breathe deeply and speeds up the circulation of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body; this saturates each cell with oxygen.</p>
  <h3>Posture</h3>
  <p>The way we stand and sit affects the amount of air the lungs can hold. When we sit up straight and walk tall, we allow them to enlarge and work at full capacity. When we habitually stoop or slouch it is impossible to breathe deeply. Superficial breathing soon becomes a habit and the lungs lose their power to expand and receive a sufficient supply of oxygen.</p>
  <h3>Clothing</h3>
  <p>What we wear affects the amount of oxygen available for our use. Loose comfortable clothing allows the lungs freedom to inflate; tight, constrictive clothing around the abdomen tends to restrict breathing.</p>
  <h3>Plants</h3>
  <p>From the rainforest to the city park to the home, 
plants serve the very important function of recycling the atmosphere.
They absorb carbon dioxide from the air and produce oxygen for us to breathe.
Some provide the added advantage of removing toxic pollutant from the air.</p>
  <h3>Rural Environment</h3>
  <p>Fresh air has a different chemical makeup from the indoor air most of us breathe; 
it is ionized or electrically charge, which is the primary reason for its multitude of 
health advantages. This air is produced in natural settings, around trees and moving water, 
in sunlight, and after thunderstorms.</p>
 <p>Fresh country air soothes the nerves, stimulates the appetite, 
and induces sound, refreshing sleep.</p>
 <p>Whenever possible, exercise outdoors and in the morning, when the air is cleanest.
Most people use less than half of their lung capacity. T
hey are not getting all the potential benefits from the air they breathe. 
Consciously use your stomach muscles to fill and empty your lungs several times a day, 
and deep breathing will soon become a habit.</p>
